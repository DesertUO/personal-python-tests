# Personal Python Tests
A repository for my small Python code snippets, experiments, and practice scripts.

V1

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that I've written for personal testing, learning, and exploration. These scripts range from basic exercises to more advanced concepts, serving as a sandbox to practice and test new ideas, libraries, and algorithms.
They are mixed between English and Spanish (my first language).

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to:
- Experiment with Python concepts, syntax, and libraries.
- Implement and test new coding ideas and algorithms.
- Document and track progress on my Python learning journey. (well uhm)

## Structure
For the moment there is none. I just threw them in the root directory.

## How to Use
Feel free to browse through the files and use them as references or inspiration for your projects. If you find any useful patterns or functions, you’re welcome to reuse or modify them.

## Requirements
Some scripts may require external libraries, which you can install via pip. For example:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## License
This repository is licensed under the MIT License, so feel free to use and modify the code as you wish.
